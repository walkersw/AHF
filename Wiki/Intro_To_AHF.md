Introduction to the AHF Mesh Data Structure
===========================================

Unstructured meshes provide the scaffold for many kinds of numerical methods, especially Finite Element Methods (FEM).  This software provides a C++ class for managing and manipulating unstructured simplex meshes.  It is based on the Array-based Half-Facet (AHF) data structure, presented here:

Dyedov, V.; Ray, N.; Einstein, D.; Jiao, X.; Tautges, T.
"AHF: array-based half-facet data structure for mixed-dimensional and non-manifold meshes,"
Engineering with Computers, Springer London, 2015, 31, 389-404
```

The tutorials consist of reading through the demo C++ codes, i.e. there is no online walk-through here.  The code is very well written and walks you through it.  However, in order to understand the data structure that this library implements, you need to read the above reference!
